## Requirements

You'll need npm and a terminal to run this project. Open a terminal and run these commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/GregoryBrinkman/API-example.git
cd API-example
npm install

After that, your api server will be running on port 3000. Open a web browser and go to `localhost:3000`.
